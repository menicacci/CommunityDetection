# Community Detection in Graphs
Small Java project inspired from the Algorithm for Big Data lectures. 

The objective is to analyze a graph with respect to the presence of communities. Every community is expected to represent a dense subgraph with weak connections to other communities. With communities, we have an high-level outlook of the whole network.
